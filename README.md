## Requirements

To use Clover P2P Reverse Shell, you must have Python 3 installed on both computers.
<br>

## Installation
<br>
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal or command prompt.
<br>

## Usage

<br>
Start the script on both computers by running python clover.py in your terminal or command prompt.
Choose the mode you want to use: either listen for incoming connections or connect to a peer.
